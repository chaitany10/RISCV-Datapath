//Instruction Memory using Verilog
//1 January 2019
At every posedge pc is incremented by 4.
Instruction Memory has been implemented by using a 2-D array. PC stores the index of that array and gets incremented by 4 at every posedge. 
Then if we give a reset signal it again points to the first instruction in the instruction memeory.
